A-mi-kuks prowl the edges of isolated communities, snatching those careless enough to wander too far from camp. They also submerge themselves beneath frozen waters, coming up from below to grab and strangle lone fishermen.  \n**Fear of Flames.** A-mi-kuks have a deathly fear of fire, and anyone using fire against one has a good chance of making it flee in terror, even if the fire-user would otherwise be outmatched. A-mi-kuks are not completely at the mercy of this fear, however, and lash out with incredible fury if cornered by someone using fire against them.  \n**Unknown Origins.** A-mi-kuks are not natural creatures and contribute little to the ecosystems in which they live. The monsters are never seen together, and some believe them to be a single monster, an evil spirit made flesh that appears whenever a group of humans has angered the gods. A-mi-kuks have no known allies and viciously attack any creatures that threaten them, regardless of the foe’s size or power.","name":"A-mi-kuk","size":"Huge","type":"Aberration","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"chaotic evil","armor_class":14,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":115,"hit_dice":"10d12+50","speed":{"swim":40,"burrow":20,"walk":30},"strength":21,"dexterity":8,"constitution":20,"intelligence":7,"wisdom":14,"charisma":10,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":null,"constitution_save":null,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":null,"charisma_save":null,"perception":5,"skills":{"athletics":10,"perception":5,"stealth":2},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"acid; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks","damage_immunities":"cold","condition_immunities":"paralyzed, restrained","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 30 ft., passive Perception 15","languages":"understands Common but can’t speak","challenge_rating":"7","cr":7.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The a-mi-kuk makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its grasping claw."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Its eyes glow with a lambent green light, and the air around it bends and distorts as if viewed through a thick lens._  \n**Hungry Lake Monsters.** The aalpamac is a dangerous freshwater predator native to lakes and rivers. While primarily a water-dwelling monster, the aalpamac can haul itself onto shore with its front claws and does so to attack prey drinking or moving at the water’s edge. While not evil, the aalpamac is a ravenous and territorial creature, ranging over an area of up to a dozen miles in search of fresh meat. Aalpamacs are not picky about what they consume and even attack large boats if sufficiently hungry. They are solitary creatures and tolerate others of their own kind only during mating seasons.  \n**Local Legends.** An aalpamac that terrorizes the same lake or river for many years often develops a reputation among the locals of the area, particularly those living along the body of water in question. Inevitably, this gives rise to a number of stories exaggerating the size, ferocity, disposition, or powers of the aalpamac. The stories often give aalpamacs names that highlight their most prominent features or are specific to the area in which they live, such as “Chompo” or “the Heron Lake Monster.” These stories also make the aalpamac the target of adventurers and trophy hunters, most of whom either do not locate the beast or fall victim to it.","name":"Aalpamac","size":"Huge","type":"Monstrosity","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"unaligned","armor_class":16,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":136,"hit_dice":"13d12+52","speed":{"walk":15,"swim":50},"strength":21,"dexterity":10,"constitution":19,"intelligence":2,"wisdom":16,"charisma":10,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":null,"constitution_save":7,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":null,"charisma_save":null,"perception":6,"skills":{"perception":6},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"cold","damage_immunities":"","condition_immunities":"","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 16","languages":"—","challenge_rating":"7","cr":7.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The aalpamac makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Many scholars turn to the giants’ deep connection with the earth as evidence of this fact, and the giants themselves make no efforts to deny it. Indeed, the oral tradition of the abbanith giants dates back millennia, to a time when gods walked the land, elves were first learning the secrets of magic, and humans were still living in caves. Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.  \n**Consummate Diggers.** Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants’ unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of derro and duergar slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.  \n**Allies of the Earth.** For as long as either race can remember, abbanith giants have been allies of the Open Game License","name":"Abbanith Giant","size":"Large","type":"Giant","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"neutral","armor_class":13,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":76,"hit_dice":"9d10+27","speed":{"burrow":30,"walk":40},"strength":20,"dexterity":9,"constitution":17,"intelligence":10,"wisdom":13,"charisma":11,"strength_save":7,"dexterity_save":null,"constitution_save":5,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":null,"charisma_save":null,"perception":null,"skills":{},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"","damage_immunities":"","condition_immunities":"","senses":"tremorsense 120 ft., passive Perception 11","languages":"Giant, Terran","challenge_rating":"3","cr":3.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The abbanith giant makes two thumb claw attacks."},{"name":"Thumb Claw","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

Although a few wizards have discovered magical methods of summoning them, none have found a way to control or communicate with them. Akaasits seem to be drawn to spellcasters with some mastery of time magic, though it is always a gamble if an individual akaasit will protect or ruthlessly attack such a spellcaster. An akaasit’s demeanor can change each day, and many time magic spellcasters have been found slain by the same akaasit that faithfully protected them the day prior.  \n**Dispersed Destruction.** If an akaasit is destroyed, it falls apart into a pile of gray triangles.

The eccentricities of the well-to-do help to cast off any suspicion over their odd coverings.  \n**As Good As Gold.** The arachnocrat’s preferred prey comes at a high price. Blessed by the Arch-Devil of Greed, Mammon, arachnocrats have a second stomach that can turn common rocks into faux gemstones. The fiends vomit up the gemstones after digesting the rocks for a few months, and they use the gemstones to fund their endeavors. The counterfeit nature of the gems is detectable by only true craftsmen.","name":"Arachnocrat","size":"Medium","type":"Fiend","subtype":"devil","group":null,"alignment":"lawful evil","armor_class":15,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":93,"hit_dice":"17d8+17","speed":{"walk":30,"climb":40},"strength":13,"dexterity":17,"constitution":12,"intelligence":16,"wisdom":14,"charisma":18,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":5,"constitution_save":null,"intelligence_save":4,"wisdom_save":null,"charisma_save":6,"perception":null,"skills":{"deception":8,"insight":4,"persuasion":6,"stealth":5},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"cold; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons","damage_immunities":"fire, poison","condition_immunities":"poisoned","senses":"blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12","languages":"Common, Infernal, telepathy 120 ft.","challenge_rating":"5","cr":5.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The arachnocrat makes two claw attacks.

As the world thawed, avalanche screamers fled to mountain peaks and polar regions to hunt smaller prey. Avalanche screamer lairs contain a jumble of bones from their victims but have no other commonalities.  \n**Devious Hunter.** A versatile predator, the avalanche screamer can attack its prey from the ground beneath or from cliffs and trees above. It prefers to pick off its victims one at a time, grabbing stragglers at the back of a group and killing them before returning to the group. When it must face multiple foes simultaneously, it uses its scream to inflict harm on as many targets as possible. In unstable areas, the sound can cause avalanches, which the avalanche screamer rides out unscathed. It then uses its ability to detect vibrations to locate survivors, tunnel its way toward them, and devour them.  \n**Summer Hibernation.** Because avalanche screamers become lethargic and vulnerable in warmer temperatures, they hide themselves during the brief summers in their mountaintop and polar habitats. In preparation for their summer slumbers, they aggressively hunt prey, fattening themselves or stockpiling in their lairs. As a precaution against hunters that might follow them to their lairs, avalanche screamers often collect their food from miles away and tunnel through the ground to leave no tracks. Those who manage to track the creatures and hope to easily dispatch them while they are sluggish find avalanche screamers quickly shake their torpor to defend themselves.","name":"Avalanche Screamer","size":"Large","type":"Aberration","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"chaotic evil","armor_class":15,"armor_desc":"natural armor","hit_points":133,"hit_dice":"14d10+56","speed":{"burrow":20,"walk":40,"climb":30},"strength":18,"dexterity":9,"constitution":19,"intelligence":5,"wisdom":12,"charisma":8,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":null,"constitution_save":null,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":4,"charisma_save":null,"perception":null,"skills":{"athletics":7,"stealth":5},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"cold","damage_immunities":"bludgeoning, thunder","condition_immunities":"frightened, prone","senses":"tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 11","languages":"—","challenge_rating":"7","cr":7.0,"actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"The avalanche screamer makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its legs."},{"name":"Bite","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
