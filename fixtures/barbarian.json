    "desc": "### Rage \n \nIn battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \n \nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: \n \n* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. \n* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. \n* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n \nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \n \nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n \n### Unarmored Defense \n \nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \n \n### Reckless Attack \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n \n### Danger Sense \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \n \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n \n### Primal Path \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Fast Movement \n \nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \n \n### Feral Instinct \n \nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n \nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n \n### Brutal Critical \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \n \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n \n### Relentless Rage \n \nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n \nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n \n### Persistent Rage \n \nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n \n### Indomitable Might \n \nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n \n### Primal Champion \n \nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.",

As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. \n \n##### Frenzy \n \nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A). \n \n##### Mindless Rage \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. \n \n##### Intimidating Presence \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. \n \nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. \n \n##### Retaliation \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.",

They serve at the vanguard, leading their allies at each charge and drawing their opponents' attention away from more vulnerable members of their group. As they grow more experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other integral positions.\n\n##### Roar of Defiance\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can announce your presence by unleashing a thunderous roar as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage. Until the beginning of your next turn, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.\n  Until the rage ends, if a creature within 5 feet of you that heard your Roar of Defiance deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to bellow at them. Your attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The damage you deal with this feature increases to 2d6 at 10th level. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, you can't use this feature on that creature again during this rage.\n\n##### Running Leap\nAt 3rd level, while you are raging, you can leap further. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap a number of feet equal to your Strength score. With a 10-foot running start, you can long jump a number of feet equal to twice your Strength score.\n\n##### Lion's Glory\nStarting at 6th level, when you enter your rage, you can choose a number of allies that can see you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Until the rage ends, when a chosen ally makes a melee weapon attack, the ally gains a bonus to the damage roll equal to the Rage Damage bonus you gain, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Resonant Bellow\nAt 10th level, your roars can pierce the fog of fear. As a bonus action, you can unleash a mighty roar, ending the frightened condition on yourself and each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you and who can hear you. Each creature that ceases to be frightened gains 1d12 + your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) temporary hit points for 1 hour. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Victorious Roar\nAt 14th level, you exult in your victories. When you hit with at least two attacks on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to unleash a victorious roar. One creature you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failure, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your barbarian level and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn't frightened.",

The way these aspects manifest is up to you and can include sprouting horns from your head, changing the color of your skin, growing fangs or a tail, or other small physical changes. Though infused with fiendish power, you aren't a fiend. While raging, you have resistance to fire damage, and the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes 1d6 extra fire damage.

This effect works like the fire shield spell, except you are surrounded with a warm shield only and it ends when your rage ends. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n#####Devilish Essence\nAt 14th level, while raging, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and if you take damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level.",

If you are already proficient in Stealth, you gain proficiency in another barbarian class skill of your choice.\n\n##### Mistwood Defender\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the Reckless Attack feature on ranged weapon attacks with thrown weapons, and, while you aren't within melee range of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, you can draw and throw a thrown weapon as a bonus action.\n  In addition, when you make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon using Strength while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the damage you deal with the thrown weapon.\n\n##### From the Mist\nBeginning at 6th level, mist and fog don't hinder your vision.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### War Band's Passage\nStarting at 14th level, when you use your From the Mist feature to cast misty step, you can bring up to two willing creatures within 5 feet of you along with you, as long as each creature isn't carrying more than its carrying capacity.

Others may recognize or even fully embrace them as useful to their own ambitions. Still others view this path as embarrassing at best and insulting at worst, for what puny, two-legged creature can ever hope to come close to the natural ferocity of a dragon? When choosing this path, consider what experiences drove you to such a course. These experiences will help inform how you deal with the judgment of dragons you encounter in the world.\n\n##### Totem Dragon\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you choose which type of dragon you seek to emulate. You can speak and read Draconic, and you are resistant to the damage type of your chosen dragon.\n\n| Dragon | Damage Type | \n|---------------------|-------------| \n| Black or Copper | Acid | \n| Blue or Bronze | Lightning | \n| Brass, Gold, or Red | Fire | \n| Green | Poison | \n| Silver or White | Cold |\n\n##### Wyrm Teeth\nAt 3rd level, your jaws extend and become dragon-like when you enter your rage. While raging, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with your bite against one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. You are proficient with the bite. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier + damage of the type associated with your totem dragon equal to your proficiency bonus.\n\n##### Legendary Might\nStarting at 6th level, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature twice between long rests.\n\n##### Aspect of the Dragon\nAt 10th level, you take on additional draconic features while raging. When you enter your rage, choose one of the following aspects to manifest.\n\n***Dragon Heart.*** You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your barbarian level. Once you manifest this aspect, you must finish a short or long rest before you can manifest it again.\n\n***Dragon Hide.*** Scales sprout across your skin. Your Armor Class increases by 2.\n\n***Dragon Sight.*** Your senses become those of a dragon. You have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.\n\n***Dragon Wings.*** You sprout a pair of wings that resemble those of your totem dragon. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless it is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\n\n##### Wyrm Lungs\nAt 14th level, while raging, you can use an action to make a breath weapon attack. You exhale your breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier), taking 12d8 damage of the type associated with your totem dragon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If a creature is raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, its weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Preemptive Parry\nAt 14th level, if you are raging and a creature you can see within your reach hits another creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the lower of the two rolls.

            "slug": "path-of-thorns",
            "desc": "Path of Thorns barbarians use ancient techniques developed by the druids of old that enable them to grow thorns all over their body. The first barbarians of this path fought alongside these druids to defend the natural order. In the centuries since, the knowledge of these techniques has spread, allowing others access to this power.\n  Though named for the thorns that covered the first barbarians to walk this path, current followers of this path can display thorns, spines, or boney growths while raging.\n\n##### Blossoming Thorns\nBeginning at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, hard, sharp thorns emerge over your whole body, turning your unarmed strikes into dangerous weapons. When you hit with an unarmed strike while raging, your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, while raging, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.\n  The unarmed strike damage you deal while raging increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 8th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.\n\n##### Thorned Grasp\nAlso at 3rd level, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature while raging, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds, and it takes 1d4 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns, provided you continue to grapple the creature and are raging. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.\n\n##### Nature's Blessing\nAt 6th level, the thorns you grow while raging become more powerful and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature within 5 feet of you while raging, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.\n  Alternatively, while raging, you can use your reaction to disarm a creature that hits you with a melee weapon while within 5 feet of you by catching its weapon in your thorns instead of the attacker taking damage from your thorns. The attacker must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or drop the weapon it used to attack you. The weapon lands at its feet. The attacker must be wielding a weapon for you to use this reaction.\n\n##### Toxic Infusion\nStarting at 10th level, when you enter your rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can infuse your thorns with toxins for 1 minute. While your thorns are infused with toxins, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with an unarmed strike must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Thorn Barrage\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to shoot the thorns from your body while raging. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

            "desc": "Honed to assault the lairs of powerful threats to their way of life, or defend against armed hordes of snarling goblinoids, the juggernauts represent the finest of frontline destroyers within the primal lands and beyond.\n\n##### Thunderous Blows\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage instills you with the strength to batter around your foes, making any battlefield your domain. Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, you push the target 5 feet away from you, and you can choose to immediately move 5 feet into the target’s previous position. ##### Stance of the Mountain\nYou harness your fury to anchor your feet to the earth, shrugging off the blows of those who wish to topple you. Upon choosing this path at 3rd level, you cannot be knocked prone while raging unless you become unconscious.\n\n##### Demolishing Might\nBeginning at 6th level, you can muster destructive force with your assault, shaking the core of even the strongest structures. All of your melee attacks gain the siege property (your attacks deal double damage to objects and structures). Your melee attacks against creatures of the construct type deal an additional 1d8 weapon damage.\n\n##### Overwhelming Cleave\nUpon reaching 10th level, you wade into armies of foes, great swings of your weapon striking many who threaten you. When you make a weapon attack while raging, you can make another attack as a bonus action with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\n\n##### Unstoppable\nStarting at 14th level, you can become “unstoppable” when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of the rage your speed cannot be reduced, and you are immune to the frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions. If you are frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, you can still take your bonus action to enter your rage and suspend the effects for the duration of the rage. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A, PHB).",
