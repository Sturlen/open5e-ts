            "desc": "This long scroll bears strange runes and seals of eldritch powers. When you use an action to present this scroll to an aberration whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the aberration, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 psychic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.",

Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.

The open locket stores what you see and experience for up to 10 minutes. You can shut the locket at any time (no action required), stopping the memory recording. Opening the locket with the command word again overwrites the contained memory. While a memory is stored, you or another creature can touch the locket to experience the memory from the beginning. Breaking contact ends the memory early. In addition, you have advantage on any skill check related to details or knowledge of the stored memory. If you die while wearing the amulet, it preserves you. Your body is affected by the gentle repose spell until the amulet is removed or until you are restored to life. In addition, at the moment of your death, you can store any memory into the amulet. A creature touching the amulet perceives the memory stored there even after your death. Attuning to an amulet of memory removes any prior memories stored in it.",

The broom’s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble—just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.\n\n_**Sentience.**_ The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17\\. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. \n\n_**Personality.**_ The broom’s purpose is to encourage the use of magic—the more powerful the better—regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.\n\n**_Demands._** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is _blinded_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Ancient Broom_, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.\n\n**DC 18** The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.\n\n**DC 21** Many of those who have wielded the _Ancient Broom_ came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Ancient Broom_ has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast __pass without trace_  (no _concentration_  required) and _nondetection_ at will.\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a _short rest_ , learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.\n\n**Dancing Broom**\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your _attack roll_  and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or _invisible_  it has _advantage_  on its attack roll.\n\n While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the broom to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\n\n The broom ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.",

In addition, the ornately decorated head of the mace holds a reservoir perforated with small holes. As an action, you can fill the reservoir with a single potion or vial of liquid, such as holy water or alchemist's fire. You can press a button on the haft of the weapon as a bonus action, which opens the holes. If you hit a target with the weapon while the holes are open, the weapon deals damage as normal and the target suffers the effects of the liquid. For example,\nan anointing mace filled with holy water deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage if it hits a fiend or undead. After you press the button and make an attack roll, the liquid is expended, regardless if your attack hits.",

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.

Once you have attuned to the weapon, while wielding it you gain the following features:\n\n◆ Weapon attacks using the sword score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\n\n◆ The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\n\n◆ You can use a bonus action to speak this sword’s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed _bright light_  in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d8 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.\n\n◆ You can use a bonus action to toss this sword into the air and speak a different command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover and the consciousness inside of it awakens, transforming it into a creature. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. You can transform the sword into a creature for up to 10 minutes, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. The sword regains 5 minutes of transforming capability for every 12 hours that feature is not in use.\n\nWhen you act in a way that Asi finds contemptible (performing deeds that conflict with effecting the destruction of the enemies of the gods and restoring the Dharma), the sword acts under its own free will unless you succeed on an opposed Charisma check at the end of each minute.\n\n**_Sentience._** Asi is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 16, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 16\\. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand Sanskrit and Tamil.\n\n_**Personality.**_ The sword’s purpose is to effect the destruction of the enemies of the gods and restoring the Dharma. It is single-minded in its purpose and highly motivated, but not unreasonable or averse to compromising its interests for a short time while in the pursuit of the greater good.\n\n_**Destroying the Sword.**_ The sword can never be permanently destroyed. When reduced to 0 hit points, Asi fades into the Ethereal Plane, reappearing in a location of its choosing 1d4 weeks later.\n\n_**Asi**_   \n_Challenge 8_  \n_Small construct 3,900 XP_  \n**AC** 16 (natural armor)  \n**HP** 102 (12d6+60; bloodied 51)  \n**Speed** fly 40 ft.

You can use an action to pull the spiky object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a 1d8 and consulting the below table. The creature is a bramble version (see sidebar) of the beast listed in the table. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three spiky objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn. Alternatively, one willing animal companion or familiar can be placed in the bag for 1 week. A non-beast animal companion or familiar that is placed in the bag is treated as if it had been placed into a bag of holding and can be removed from the bag at any time. A beast animal companion or familiar disappears once placed in the bag, and the bag's magic is dormant until the week is up. At the end of the week, the animal companion or familiar exits the bag as a bramble creature (see the template in the sidebar) and can be returned to its original form only with a wish. The creature retains its status as an animal companion or familiar after its transformation and can choose to activate or deactivate its Thorn Body trait as a bonus action. A transformed familiar can be re-summoned with the find familiar spell. Once the bag has been used to change an animal companion or familiar into a bramble creature, it becomes an ordinary, nonmagical bag. | 1d8 | Creature |\n| --- | ------------ |\n| 1 | Weasel |\n| 2 | Giant rat |\n| 3 | Badger |\n| 4 | Boar |\n| 5 | Panther |\n| 6 | Giant badger | Only a beast can become a bramble creature.

At the same time, the humanoid who pledged their blood to the coin takes necrotic damage and reduces their hit point maximum by an equal amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. It dies if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. You can expend the charges in up to 5 blood marks as part of the same action. To replenish an expended charge in a blood mark, a humanoid must pledge a pint of their blood in a 10-minute ritual that involves letting a drop of their blood fall through the center of the coin. The drop disappears in the process and the center fills with a red glow. There is no limit to how much blood a humanoid may pledge, but each coin can hold only 1 charge. To pledge more, the humanoid must perform the ritual on another blood mark. Any person foolish enough to pledge more than a single blood coin might find the coins all redeemed at once, since such redemptions often happen at great blood feasts held by vampires and other undead.",

Its covers often reflect light as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and Shadow Fey (see Tome of Beasts). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options.

You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell’s level. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).\n\nWhen you expend charges from the _Cane of Chaos_, it unleashes another chaotic magical effect, either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.\n\n__**Table: Cane of Chaos**__\n| **d8** | **Wild Magic Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1      | One random creature you see is subject to a _polymorph_  spell cast by the cane (using your spell save DC), turning it into a random CR 1/8 beast.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 2      | The 1d6 doors nearest to you come under an _arcane lock_  effect as though cast by the creature nearest to you that can speak, write, or sign at least one language.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 3      | The cane creates a __control weather_  effect, driving the weather towards unseasonable extreme temperatures and conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| 4      | Each creature within 60 feet rolls 1d6, increasing a random ability score to 18 for the next 10 minutes (1: Strength, 2: Dexterity, 3: Constitution, 4: Intelligence, 5: Wisdom, 6: Charisma).                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 5      | Each creature within 60 feet is subject to a __levitation_ effect created by the cane (using your spell save DC).

However, wielding anything else begins to feel wrong to you, and you suffer _disadvantage_  on all melee weapon attacks made with a different weapon.\n\n_Apprentice:_ You gain +1 to _attack and damage rolls_ with this weapon.

The work still influences the art of crafting magic items to this day. \n\n A regular copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ is a masterwork book about crafting magic items. Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles—a copy annotated by a mad genius. Known as the _Crafter’s Codex_, this copy of the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia. To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one’s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within. Alas, no owner seems to hold on to the _Crafter’s Codex_ for long. The book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader and then simply disappear, presumably in search of someone more suited to its talents and disposition.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Crafter’s Codex_, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.\n\n**DC 18** This book is a unique annotated version of the more common _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_.\n\n**DC 21** The Crafter’s Codex can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Crafter’s Codex_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.\n\nIn addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the _Crafter’s Codex_, or keeping the book safely in your possession.\n\nOnce between _long rests_ , while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the _Crafter’s Codex_ and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:\n\n* Reduce research time by 75%.\n* Reduce component cost by 75%.\n* Reduce crafting time by 75%.\n* Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.\n* Reduce a crafting DC by 6.\n\nAfter three failures on the Intelligence check, th_e Crafter’s Codex_ moves on. You retain a copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ but the magic and marginalia of the _Crafter’s Codex_ magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it. Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first). \n\n**Seekers of the Codex**\n\nThe _Crafter’s Codex_ is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the Crafter’s Codex surely means encountering some of the following foes.\n\n__**Table: Seekers of the Codex**__\n| **1d6** | **Adversary**                                                         |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Noble with entourage of bodyguards—previous owner or antimagic zealot |\n| 2       | _Assassin_ , stealthy _mage_ , or _thief_                             |\n| 3       | Rival artificer (friendly or hostile)                                 |\n| 4       | Mischievous book-obsessed fey                                         |\n| 5       | Celestial or fiendish curator of an interplanar library               |\n| 6       | Rival artificer from an entirely different Material Plane             |\n\n**Destruction**\n\nThe secret knowledge that permeates the Crafter’s Codex cannot simply be stricken from the world with ink, blade, or fire. When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the _Crafter’s Codex_ is to eliminate every last copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse—if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the _Crafter’s Codex_ persists.",

            "desc": "This crown looks like a braid of pure crystal and its front is a set of three pointed, curling spires that give its wearer an imposing, regal silhouette. Once worn by the monarch of an ancient crystal palace deep underground, the crown was lost after its wearer’s grasping schemes brought calamity on their people. The power, ambition, and ruthless might of the Crystal Sovereign of Coranaal still lingers, granting the wearer the following properties:\n\n_**Crystal Skin.**_ Your skin takes on a jagged, shimmering appearance and feels firm and cold to the touch. You gain +2 to your Armor Class. Additionally, when you’re hit by a ranged spell attack, roll 1d4\\. On a 3, you are unaffected and the spell is reflected back at its caster, rolling again to see if it hits.\n\n**_All-Seeing._** You gain truesight out to 30 feet. Additionally, you can use this trait to cast __clairvoyance_  at will, using the crown as your material component.\n\n**_Lord Under The Mountain._** Your Prestige Rating is increased by 2, or 4 if you’re underground.\n\n**_Regal Bearing._** A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can, as an action, target one creature that can see you within 60 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom _saving throw_  (DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier) or use its next turn to fall _prone_  in supplication, taking no other actions. Additionally, when you’re targeted with any attack by a creature within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make this saving throw as a reaction. On a failure it has _disadvantage_  on the attack and then falls prone as above.\n\n**_Greed of Coronaal._** It’s said that, even as their palace crumbled, the Crystal Sovereign still coveted and guarded their treasures. You can use an action to summon an item from the hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you can access remotely. You instinctively know what’s inside, and when you first access the hoard, roll on _Treasure_  for Challenge Ratings 23-30 to determine what’s already there. This doesn’t mean that you have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in the hoard.\n\nYou can also use an action to touch an item of up to Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature, creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it remotely. Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing another interdimensional item, such as a _portable hole_ , in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 (2d4) random valuables from the horde are also lost in this way, though the crown of the crystal sovereign is otherwise unaffected.\n\n_**Curse.**_ When you attune to this crown, your _Destiny_  immediately changes to _Dominion_  if it’s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and suffer a level of _strife_  each week until you pursue the opportunity, at which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.\n\nThe crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying the item.\n\n**_Escalation._** When you fulfill this destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft, your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast __scrying_  at will using the crown as a focus.",

A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\n\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\n\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.

Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\n| Playing Card       | Card        |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Ace of diamonds    | Vizier\\*    |\n| King of diamonds   | Sun         |\n| Queen of diamonds  | Moon        |\n| Jack of diamonds   | Star        |\n| Two of diamonds    | Comet\\*     |\n| Ace of hearts      | The Fates\\* |\n| King of hearts     | Throne      |\n| Queen of hearts    | Key         |\n| Jack of hearts     | Knight      |\n| Two of hearts      | Gem\\*       |\n| Ace of clubs       | Talons\\*    |\n| King of clubs      | The Void    |\n| Queen of clubs     | Flames      |\n| Jack of clubs      | Skull       |\n| Two of clubs       | Idiot\\*     |\n| Ace of spades      | Donjon\\*    |\n| King of spades     | Ruin        |\n| Queen of spades    | Euryale     |\n| Jack of spades     | Rogue       |\n| Two of spades      | Balance\\*   |\n| Joker (with TM)    | Fool\\*      |\n| Joker (without TM) | Jester      |\n\n\\*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\n\n**_Balance_**. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n**_Star_**. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n**_Sun_**. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\n**_Talons_**. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\n**_Throne_**. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n**_Vizier_**. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\n**_The Void_**. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. \n\n",

            "desc": "A legend of ruination and wonder to those that have heard of it, the _Deck of Many Things_ is the fickle power of fate distilled. Most were created by gods of luck and are found in small and ornately carved coffers and have only 13 cards, but some have the full 22\\. The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1–3, or a full deck on a 4).\n\nBefore drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card's magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to fly out of the deck and take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nOnce you have drawn the number of cards that you’ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4\\. On a 1–3 the deck vanishes, or on a 4 it returns to its coffer, allowing you to transport it should you so choose.\n\nThe Balance, Comet, Donjon, Fates, Fool, Gem, Idiot, Talons, and Vizier cards only appear in the 22 card deck.\n\n---\n\n♣ **Ace of Clubs: Talons.** Every magical item that you own is immediately destroyed. Artifacts are not destroyed and are instead cast into the multiverse.\n\n♣ **King of Clubs: Void.** Your soul is torn from your body and trapped in an object in a location of the Narrator’s choosing where it is guarded by powerful beings. While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. Even a _wish_ cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.\n\n♣ **Queen of Clubs: Flames.** You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.\n\n♣ **Jack of Clubs: Skull.** A merciless harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. It cannot be harmed by anyone other than you, and if anyone other than you attempts to harm it, another harbinger of death is summoned for them. Creatures slain by a harbinger cannot be restored to life by any means.\n\n♣ **Two of Clubs: Idiot.** Your Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d4+1, to a minimum of 1\\. You may draw one additional card beyond what you declared.\n\n♦ **Ace of Diamonds: Vizier.** At any point within a year of drawing this card, you may ask a question while meditating and immediately receive a truthful answer that helps you to solve a problem or dilemma as well as the wisdom and the knowledge to apply it.\n\n♦ **King of Diamonds: Sun.** You gain 50,000 XP, and a randomly determined wondrous item appears in your hands.\n\n♦ **Queen of Diamonds: Moon.** You are granted 1d3 wishes (as the __wish_ spell).\n\n♦ **Jack of Diamonds: Star.** Increase an ability score of your choice by 2\\. The score cannot exceed 24.\n\n♦ **Two of Diamonds: Comet.** Defeating the next hostile monster or group of monsters alone will grant you enough experience points to advance to the next level.\n\n♥ **Ace of Hearts: Fates.** You are granted the ability to reweave the fabric of reality, allowing you to circumvent or erase a single event as though it had never happened. You may use this ability immediately upon drawing the card or at any point prior to your death.\n\n♥ **King of Hearts: Throne.** You are granted proficiency in the Persuasion skill and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You are also granted legal domain over a small keep or fortress on the plane that your character inhabits. Your new domain is overrun by monsters and must be liberated before it can be inhabited.\n\n♥ **Queen of Hearts: Key.** A magic weapon of at least rare rarity that you are proficient with appears in your hand. The weapon is chosen by the Narrator.\n\n♥ **Jack of Hearts: Knight.** A _veteran_  appears and offers you their service, believing it to be destiny, and will serve you loyalty unto death. You control this character.\n\n♥ **Two of Hearts: Gem.** You are showered in wealth. A total of 25 trinkets, easily portable pieces of art, or jewelry worth 2,000 gold each, or 50 gems worth 1,000 gold each appear directly in front of you. \n\n♠ **Ace of Spades: Donjon.** You vanish and are trapped in an extradimensional space. You are either unconscious in a sphere (50%) or trapped in a nightmare realm drawn from your own experiences and fears (50%). You remain in your prison until you are freed. While divination magics cannot locate you, a wish spell reveals the location of your prison. You cannot draw any more cards.\n\n♠ **King of Spades: Ruin.** All nonmagical wealth that you own is lost. Material items vanish. Property and other holdings are lost along with any documentation. You are destitute.\n\n♠ **Queen of Spades: Euryale.** You are _cursed_  by the card. You suffer a permanent –2 penalty to all _saving throws_ . Only a god or the Fates Card can end this curse.\n\n♠ **Jack of Spades: Rogue.** A trusted ally, friend, or other NPC (chosen by the Narrator) becomes a bitter enemy, although their identity is not revealed. They will act against you based upon their abilities and resources, and will try to utterly destroy you. Only a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility. \n\n♠ **Two of Spades: Balance.** Your history rewrites itself. You gain a randomly determined background, replacing your background feature with the new background feature. You do not change the skill proficiencies or ability score increases from your previous background, or gain new skill proficiencies or ability score increases.\n\n🃏 **Joker with Trademark: Fool.** You lose 10,000 xp and must immediately draw again. If the experience lost in this manner would cause you to lose a level, you are instead reduced to the beginning of your current level instead.\n\n🃏 **Joker without Trademark: Jester.** Fortune smiles on the foolish. Either gain 10,000 XP or draw twice more from the deck beyond what you declared.\n\n---\n\n**Harbinger of Death Challenge** —\n\n_Medium undead_ 0 XP\n\n**Armor Class** 20\n\n**Hit Points** half the hit point maximum of its summoner\n\n**Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

The harbinger sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

Long ago it was a desire to both bolster and renew their forces that led a mage to create a relic many would consider unthinkable: a scepter that twists the essence of life itself. With it the dead are remade into unrecognizable tangles of flesh that despite their deformity do the wielder of the scepter’s bidding, all as their allies are healed and empowered with vigor far beyond mortal bounds.\n\nThis heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at its sibling. \n\nNo one is certain whether it was the creator’s shame that led them to hide the scepter, or if their enemies cast it out of memory for fear of its power. What is known is that the legend of the _Dread Caduceus_ has endured and that whispers of its whereabouts have not been silenced by time.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_ you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Dread Caduceus_, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead. \n\n**DC 18** The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.\n\n**DC 21** Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a _long or short rest_ . You also have _disadvantage_  on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn. When you reduce the _Dread Caduceus_ to 0 charges, you take 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a _wish_  spell).\n\n**Cherub**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet: \n\n_**Heal.**_ The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge. \n\n**_Healing Nimbus (3 Charges)_**. A nimbus of healing appears around the creature for 1d6 rounds. For the duration, whenever the creature takes damage from an attack it regains 1 hit point, and when an attack misses the creature it regains 1d4 hit points.\n\n_**Invulnerability (3 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.\n\n_**Exhaustless (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to _fatigue_  for 1d6 days.\n\n_**Resistance (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.\n\n**_Cure (10 Charges)_**. The creature is healed of any _curses_ , _diseases_ , _poisons_ , or other negative effects, even if a _wish_  spell has previously been unsuccessful.\n\n_**Invigorate (10 Charges).**_ The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1\\. A creature can only benefit from this property once. \n\n**Skull**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the skull head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 100 feet: \n\n_**Animate Skeleton (1 Charge).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating the skeleton of its body to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _skeleton template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_. \n\n_**Animate Zombie (2 Charges).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _zombie template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus._\n\n_**Empower Undead (2 Charges).**_ Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.\n\n**_Animate Legion (6 Charges)._** You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into _zombies_ . \n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the _Dread Caduceus._ When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. \n\nIn addition, any creature you animate in this fashion retains injuries or disfigurements that were upon its corpse, and it continues to decompose.",

The eye communicates with you and other creatures within 60 feet telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Abyssal, Common, Deep Speech, and Undercommon.\n\n_**Personality.**_ The eye of elsewhere contains the soul of something utterly alien to humanoid perceptions, betrayed and plunged into a constrained form. It is constantly paranoid and convinced that some worse fate could befall it at any moment. Once attuned it will try to learn everything and anything you know, especially secrets. If you are forthcoming with information the eye grows to trust you, but can be brought into conflict if you withhold any information. When in conflict the eye shuts and you no longer gain any of the eye’s benefits or properties except for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if you divulge an important secret or the information initially withheld. \n\n_**Destroying the Eye.**_ The eye is unbreakable but it has the power to implode and disintegrate itself. Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces the eye that some horrifying and frightening threat is inevitably soon to befall it. Rather than accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and blinks out of existence.

After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades.",

The bird obeys simple commands, though it will not attack, and can fly 16 miles an hour for up to 6 hours while carrying up to 500 pounds, or at half that speed while carrying up to 1,000 pounds. The roc disappears after flying its maximum distance or when reduced to 0 hit points.

When the effect ends, the token disappears. You may spend an action to dismiss the fan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 66–90    | 550 gold   | **Tree.** While outside, you can use an action to toss the token onto an unoccupied patch of ground where it erupts into a nonmagical living oak tree. The tree is 80 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk with a branch spread of up to 20 feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 91–100   | 700 gold   | **Whip.** You can use an action to toss the token to a point that you can see within 10 feet. The token transforms into a floating whip that you can command by using a bonus action, making it move up to 20 feet and attack a creature up to 10 feet away from it. The whip has an attack bonus of +10 and deals 1d6+6 force damage.

            "desc": "A figurehead of prowess must be mounted on the bow of a ship for its magic to take effect. While mounted on a ship, the figurehead’s magic affects the ship and every creature on the ship. A figurehead can be mounted on any ship larger than a rowboat, regardless if that ship sails the sea, the sky, rivers and lakes, or the sands of the desert. A ship can have only one figurehead mounted on it at a time. Most figureheads are always active, but some have properties that must be activated. To activate a figurehead’s special property, a creature must be at the helm of the ship, referred to below as the “pilot,” and must use an action to speak the figurehead’s command word. \nAlbatross (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s pilot can double its proficiency bonus with navigator’s tools when navigating the ship. In addition, the ship’s pilot doesn’t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through fog, rain, dust storms, or other natural phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure the pilot’s vision. \nBasilisk (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s AC increases by 2. \nDragon Turtle (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to fire damage, and the ship’s damage threshold increases by 5. If the ship doesn’t normally have a damage threshold, it gains a damage threshold of 5. \nKraken (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can animate all of the ship’s ropes. If a creature on the ship uses an animated rope while taking the grapple action, the creature has advantage on the check. Alternatively, the pilot can command the ropes to move as if being moved by a crew, allowing a ship to dock or a sailing ship to sail without a crew. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action. When the ship’s ropes have been animated for a total of 10 minutes, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nManta Ray (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s speed increases by half. For example, a ship with a speed of 4 miles per hour would have a speed of 6 miles per hour while this figurehead was mounted on it. \nNarwhal (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to cold damage, and the ship can break through ice sheets without taking damage or needing to make a check. \nOctopus (Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on ships designed for water travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to dive beneath the water. The ship moves at its normal speed while underwater, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour underwater, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nSphinx (Legendary). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship that isn’t designed for air travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can command the ship to rise into the air. The ship moves at its normal speed while in the air, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches land or water. When the ship has spent a total of 8 hours in the sky, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nXorn (Very Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship designed for land travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to burrow into the earth. The ship moves at its normal speed while burrowing, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. The ship can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand, mud, earth, and stone, and it doesn’t disturb the material it moves through. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour burrowing, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.",

It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.\n\n**_Bronze Griffon (Rare)_**. This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\n**_Ebony Fly (Rare)_**.

These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Ivory Goats (Rare)_**. These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n* The _goat of traveling_ can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n* The _goat of travail_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n* The _goat of terror_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a _+1 lance_, and the other becomes a _+2 longsword_. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\n**_Marble Elephant (Rare)_**. This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)_**. This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nIf you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\n\n**_Onyx Dog (Rare)_**. This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Serpentine Owl (Rare)_**. This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.\n\n**_Silver Raven (Uncommon)_**. This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

            "desc": "These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.\n\nThe specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.\n\nThe resulting creature is friendly to you and your companions, with a notable exception listed below. It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.\n\nEach creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a duration specific to each creature, as detailed in its entry.\n\n---\n\n__**Table: Figurine of Wondrous Power**__\n| **Figurine**           | **Rarity** | **Cost**  | **Crafting Components**                   | **Property**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Bronze Griffin**     | Rare       | 5,000 gp  | Griffon feather                           | This bronze figurine is of a griffon in an aggressive posture.

Removing a horn requires an action and the weapons disappear when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates terror in a 30-foot radius while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the area makes a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or becomes _frightened_  of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

After this figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed. |\n| **Marble Elephant**    | Rare       | 5,000 gp  | Vial of elephant hairs                    | This hefty figurine is carved into the form of an elephant with a raised trunk.

Odin thrust the sword it into a tree and proclaimed that anyone who pulled it from the tree would receive the sword itself as a gift, and that none had ever borne a finer blade. Sigmund drew it, only for Odin to eventually break the blade after he had used it in several battles. The two halves were bequeathed to his son, Sigurd.\n\n_Gram_ was reforged by the dwarf Regin for Sigurd in order to slay Regin’s brother, the wizard-turned-dragon, Fafnir, and reclaim a cursed treasure. Sigurd proofed the blade on Regin’s own anvil, breaking the blade again, and then again after a second forging. Finally, on the third time, it split the anvil in half with a single stroke. Sigurd later killed Fafnir by hiding in a ditch and thrusting upwards into the drake’s unprotected belly. The ditch carried away most of the dragon’s burning, poisonous blood but _Gram_, as well as Sigrud’s arm up to the shoulder, were bathed in it, and a portion of that venomous malice remains in the sword.

It has the following additional properties. \n\n_**Red Reaping.**_ Whenever you use _Harvest_ to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature’s soul and stores it within. _Harvest_ cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature’s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.\n\n_**Sow the Reaped.**_ You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature’s soul stored within _Harvest._ This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability. Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.\n\n_**Only Life May Die.** Harvest_ has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them. \n\n_**Sentience.** Harvest_ is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17\\. It sees and hears using your senses. _Harvest_ communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.\n\n_**Personality.**_ This sickle originally had a much more benign purpose, created by a halfling archdruid to bring forth a new plant for each one harvested. When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It eventually convinced its bearer to sow what she reaped, and caused the very spirit and blood of those she had cut down to slaughter its orcish captors. _Harvest_ has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. _Harvest_ tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its “culling”. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth’s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you’ll be in conflict with _Harvest_. When in conflict, any time you use the Sow the Reaped property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into _Harvest_. \n\n_**Destroying Harvest.**_ _Harvest_ is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering _Harvest_ an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.",

Each lantern can hold any number of charges from any number of creatures, but each creature can infuse a lantern with vitality only once between long rests.\n  ***Deadbane (Uncommon).*** While holding this lantern, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cause the lantern to detect undead for 1 hour. When an undead is within 20 feet of the lantern, the light it sheds changes to blue, growing brighter the closer the undead is to the lantern. For each charge you spend beyond the first, the duration increases by 30 minutes, and the distance the lantern can detect undead increases by 5 feet. Increasing this distance doesn't increase the radius of the light shed by the lantern.\n  ***Floodmote (Very Rare).*** If you are submerged while holding or carrying this lantern, you can use a reaction and expend 1 or more of its charges to create a small bubble of air for yourself for 1 hour. For each charge you spend beyond the first, the duration increases by 1 hour, and you can choose one additional creature within 30 feet of you to also be protected with a bubble of air. The bubble of air surrounds only a creature's head or other airbreathing organ and provides breathable air to the creature for the duration.\n  ***Tumblesafe (Rare).*** If you or a friendly creature you can see within 40 feet of you falls while you are holding or carrying this lantern, you can use a reaction and expend 1 or more of its charges to slow the fall. For each charge you spend beyond the first, you can extend the light shed by the lantern by 5 feet. Each falling creature and object in the lantern's light descends at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no damage from falling. It continues to descend at this rate until it lands, even if it exits the lantern's light before it lands.",

This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\n\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\n\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\n\n**_Strength (Very Rare)_**. Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\n\n**_Sustenance (Rare)_**.

Whatever the case, there are many types of _ioun stones_, each imbued with powerful beneficial magic.\n\nThe specifics of these stones vary but they all work in essentially the same way: once you have attuned to it you can use an action to set a stone in a gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may use an action to try and take an orbiting stone, but must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. An _ioun stone’s_ AC is 24, it has 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive state.\n\n__**Table: Ioun Stones**__\n| **Type**           | **Rarity** | **Cost**  | **Crafting Components**                                                               | **Property**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Absorption         | Very rare  | 10,000 gp | Refined negative energy                                                               | While this white marble sphere orbits your head, when a creature you can see casts a spell of 4th-level or lower targeting only you, you can use your reaction to have the stone harmlessly absorb the spell, suffering no damage or negative effects.

This radiant indigo prism encases a pearl and can store spells for later use. The stone can hold up to 3 spell levels and is typically found with 1d4 – 1 levels of stored spells. To store a spell in the stone, a creature must cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell while holding it. The spell is drawn into the stone with no other effect. If there aren’t enough available levels to hold a spell, it cannot be stored. While the stone is orbiting you, you can cast any spell stored in it using the appropriate action. The spell uses the spell level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the creature that stored the spell, but you are considered to be the caster. Once a spell is cast, it is no longer stored. |\n| Strength           | Very rare  | 15,000 gp | Canine teeth from an awakened bear                                                    | While this bright pink pentagonal trapezohedron orbits your head your Strength score is increased by 2 (to a maximum of 20).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Sustenance         | Rare       | 525 gp    | Honeycomb from a giant bee beehive                                                    | While this delicate amber spindle orbits your head, when taking a long rest you can roll a d20\\.

While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings.

Either way it is this weapon and this weapon only that can kill the golden rooster Víðópnir (which sits in the branches of Yggdrasil and may be tied to Ragnarök, or possibly be another name for Gullinkambi) so that its wing joints (the only things that will suffice) can be used to distract the dogs guarding the flame-encircled castle holding Menglöð, a maiden fated to be married to the hero Svipdagr. The runed weapon awaits within however, protected by the jötunn Sinmara (a _storm giant_ ) who will only exchange it for a tail feather from the golden rooster—that can only be harmed by the very same sword, creating a paradoxical task. Its forger and the owner of the chest that contains it can reveal the secrets to bypassing the 9 locks holding its prison closed, although Loki would only ever do so if a cunning price is attached...\n\nLÆVATEINN\n\nUntil you are attuned to this staff, it appears to be a rotting quarterstaff or battered longsword. After you have attuned to it however, runes glow along the length of the wood or the blade.\n\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While wielding it, you can use a bonus action to transform it into a magic longsword or back.\n\nThe staff has 10 charges for the following properties.

You can also use an action to cast the __charm person , disguise self ,_ or __vicious mockery_  spells from the staff without using any charges.\n\nWhile it is in longsword form, the runes channel magic with less finesse and unleash lethal energies.\n\n_**Death Rune.**_ You can use a bonus action and 1 charge to activate this rune, causing shadows to flow out from the weapon for 1 minute. These shadows reduce _dim light_  in a 40-foot radius to _darkness_ , and bright light in a 20-foot radius to dim light. While the weapon is shadowed, it deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage to any target it hits. The shadows last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, the duration expires, or until you drop the weapon.\n\n_**Flame Rune.**_ You can use a bonus action and 1 charge to activate this rune, causing flames to erupt from the weapon for 1 minute. These flames shed _bright light_  in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits.

These enchanted trinkets were one of the many tools created to alleviate the problem and are now sold to more than novice mages. Each resembles a perfectly ordinary writing quill. When you spend a bonus action to speak the command word and expend 1 charge, the quill leaps to life and copies everything said by a target that you can hear within 60 feet. The quill ceases to copy after 1 hour, when the target moves more than 60 feet away from it, stops speaking for more than 10 minutes, or when it runs out of writing surface (usually a long scroll of parchment).\n\nThe magic that animates the quill can also be put to slightly more dangerous purposes. When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, as an action you hurl it at a target you can see within 10 feet. The quill leaps to life and jabs, stabs, pokes, gouges, and otherwise injures the target for up to 1 minute. The quill attacks once per round at the end of your turn. It has a +2 bonus to attack and deals 1d4 piercing damage on a successful hit. When you roll a natural 1 to attack with the quill, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item. Otherwise, it falls to the ground when its target has moved more than 15 feet away or become _incapacitated_ .\n\nThe quill has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. ",

An intricate engraving of a warrior's sword piercing a dragon's chest is detailed along the front of this untarnished silver locket. Within the locket is a clear crystal vial with a pulsing piece of a dragon's heart. The pulses become more frequent when you are close to death. Attuning to the locket requires you to mix your blood with the blood within the vial. The vial holds 3 charges of dragon blood that are automatically expended when you reach certain health thresholds. The locket regains 1 expended charge for each vial of dragon blood you place in the vial inside the locket up to a maximum of 3 charges. For the purpose of this locket, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including drakes and wyverns. While wearing or carrying the locket, you gain the following effects: - When you reach 0 hit points, but do not die outright, the vial breaks and the dragon heart stops pulsing, rendering the item broken and irreparable. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier. If the locket has at least 1 charge of dragon blood, it does not break, but this effect can't be activated again until 3 days have passed. - When you are reduced to half of your maximum hit points, the locket expends 1 charge of dragon blood, and you become immune to any type of blood loss effect, such as the blood loss from a stirge's Blood Drain, for 1d4 + 1 hours. Any existing blood loss effects end immediately when this activates.",

Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\n\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it.

The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\n\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror.

Along the top there is a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 23 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch revealing a cylinder wide enough for a Medium creature to crawl inside. The _Nautilus_ is a Gargantuan object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 25  \n**Hit Points:** 400 (damage threshold 20)  \n**Speed** swim 200 ft. (can turn a maximum of 15 degrees in a round)  \n**Damage Immunities** poison, psychic  \n**Crew Capacity** 25; **Passenger Capacity** 600  \n**Travel Pace** 58 miles per hour (460 miles per day)\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the _Nautilus_ requires one pilot at the helm. While the hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.\n\nThe steel submarine holds enough air for 15,000 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside (at most 625 for 24 hours). There are 2 decks of interior compartments, most of which are 6 feet high. Interior doors are airtight, have AC 20 and 50 hit points, and can be bypassed with DC 18 Dexterity (thieves’ tools) checks or DC 25 Strength checks.\n\nThe _Nautilus_ floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 9,000 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature at the helm can use an action to pilot the _Nautilus_ by making a DC 18 Intelligence (vehicle \\[water\\]) check, with disadvantage if there are no other creatures controlling the ballasts, hydraulics, and sensors (each an action), or with _advantage_  if each position has a creature helping. On a success, the pilot can double the effects of any acceleration, deceleration, or turning they make with the _Nautilus_ on their turn. In addition, the pilot can send the submarine careening into a creature or object, making an attack roll as usual.\n\n_**Prow.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 34 (8d6+6) piercing damage. On a natural 1, the Nautilus takes 34 (8d6+6) bludgeoning damage.\n\nAny creature in the command room can pull a lever to activate its function, but the _Nautilus_ only responds to the first 8 levers pulled in a round, and a lever only performs a function once per round. While traveling forward the lever to travel backwards does not function, and while traveling backward the level to travel forwards does not function. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position.\n\n__Nautilus Controls__\n| Lever | Up                                                                                                                                                              | Down                                                                        |\n| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1     | Forward window shutter opens.                                                                                                                                   | Forward window shutter closes.                                              |\n| 2     | Side window shutters open (20 per side).                                                                                                                        | Side window shutters close (20 per side).                                   |\n| 3     | Two manipulator arms extend from the front of the Nautilus.                                                                                                     | The manipulator arms retract.                                               |\n| 4     | Each extended manipulator arm makes the following _melee weapon attack_: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit_: The target is _grappled_  (escape DC 20). | One or both extended manipulator arms release what they are holding.        |\n| 5     | The _Nautilus_ accelerates forward, increasing its speed by 20 feet (to a maximum of 200 feet).                                                                 | The _Nautilus_ decelerates, reducing its speed by 50 feet (minimum 0 feet). |\n| 6     | The _Nautilus_ accelerates backward, increasing its speed by 20 feet (to a maximum of 200 feet).                                                                | The _Nautilus_ decelerates, reducing its speed by 50 feet (minimum 0 feet). |\n| 7     | The _Nautilus_ turns 15 degrees left.                                                                                                                           | The _Nautilus_ turns 15 degrees right.                                      |\n| 8     | Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 150 feet.                                                               | The light turns off.                                                        |\n| 9     | The _Nautilus_ sinks as much as 50 feet in liquid.                                                                                                              | The _Nautilus_ rises up to 50 feet in liquid.                               |\n| 10    | The top hatch unseals and opens.                                                                                                                                | The top hatch closes and seals.                                             |",

It's a sturdy wooden stave, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the pole's curse. The carved shaft is draped in horsehide, topped with a horse's skull, and placed where its target is expected to pass by. Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once. The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created, and the curse lasts 8 hours without requiring concentration. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target. An untriggered and forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries.",

            "desc": "Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five _Orbs of Dragonkind_ (or _Dragon Orbs_) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts _suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\n\n**_Random Properties_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ has the following random properties:\n\n* 2 minor beneficial properties\n* 1 minor detrimental property\n* 1 major detrimental property\n\n**_Spells_**. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: _cure wounds_ (5th-level version, 3 charges), _daylight_ (1 charge), _death ward_ (2 charges), or _scrying_ (3 charges).\n\nYou can also use an action to cast the _detect magic_ spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\n**_Call Dragons_**. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\n**_Destroying an Orb_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A _disintegrate_ spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

On a success, you can control the _Orb of Dragonkind,_ or on a failure you are charmed by it. Both effects last until you are no longer attuned to the orb.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you cannot choose to end your attunement to it. In addition, the orb can innately cast __suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18) to compel you to commit evil acts that serve its purposes—exacting revenge, attaining its freedom, spread suffering and ruin, encourage the worship of foul draconic deities, collect the other _orbs of dragonkind_, or whatever else the Narrator deems fit. \n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is an _Orb of Dragonkind,_ an artifact with the power to control dragons. \n\n**DC 20** Five orbs were made, each containing the soul of an evil dragon.\n\n**DC 25** The orb can summon evil dragons, but does not actually control them.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nAn _Orb of Dragonkind_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are controlling an _Orb of Dragonkind,_ you can use an action to cast detect magic at will. You can also expend 1 or more charges to cast _detect magic_ (no charge), __daylight  (_1 charge), __death ward_  (2 charges), _cure wounds_  (5th-level version, 3 charges), or __scrying_ (save DC 18; 3 charges). \n\n**The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges each dawn.**\n\n**Call Dragons**\n\nWhile you are controlling an _Orb of Dragonkind_, you can use an action to send a telepathic message in a 40-mile radius.

Once this property has been used, you cannot use it again for 1 hour.\n\n**Destroying an Orb**\n\nDespite its glass appearance, an _Orb of Dragonkind_ is immune to most types of damage (including draconic breath weapons and natural attacks), but they can be destroyed by the __disintegrate_ spell or a single strike from a weapon with a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls.",

Arcane sigils decorate each orb, detailing its properties to those capable of reading the sigils. The magic-infused chemicals in each orb must be briefly exposed to air before being thrown to activate them. A metal rod sits in the cork of each orb, allowing you to quickly twist open the container before throwing it. Typically, 1d4 + 1 orbs of obfuscation are found together. You can use an action to activate and throw the orb up to 60 feet. The orb explodes on impact and is destroyed. The orb's effects are determined by its type. Orb of Obfuscation (Uncommon). This orb is a dark olive color with a stripe of bright blue paint encircling it. When activated, the orb releases an opaque grey gas and creates a 30-foot-radius sphere of this gas centered on the point where the orb landed. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The magical gas also dampens sound. Each creature in the gas can hear only sounds originating within 5 feet of it, and creatures outside of the gas can’t hear sounds originating inside the gas.

This oblong orb has a putty grey color with a stripe of yellow paint encircling it. When activated, this orb releases the same opaque grey gas as the orb of obfuscation. In addition to the effects of that gas, this orb also releases a burst of caustic chemicals on impact. Each creature within a 15-foot radius of where the orb landed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d4 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails this saving throw, the chemicals cling to it for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 acid damage from the clinging chemicals.

A creature remains attuned to the mirror as long as it is on the same plane of existence as the mirror or until it chooses to end its attunement to the mirror during a short rest. Phase mirrors look almost identical to standard mirrors, but their surfaces are slightly clouded. These mirrors are found in a variety of sizes, from handheld to massive disks. The larger the mirror, the more power it can take in, and consequently, the more creatures it can affect. When it is created, a mirror is connected to a specific plane. The mirror draws in starlight and uses that energy to move between its current plane and its connected plane. While holding or touching a fully charged mirror, an attuned creature can use an action to speak the command word and activate the mirror. When activated, the mirror transports all creatures attuned to it to the mirror's connected plane or back to the Material Plane at a destination of the activating creature's choice. This effect works like the plane shift spell, except it transports only attuned creatures, regardless of their distance from each other, and the destination must be on the Material Plane or the mirror's connected plane. If the mirror is broken, its magic ends, and each attuned creature is trapped in whatever plane it occupies when the mirror breaks. Once activated, the mirror stays active for 24 hours and any attuned creature can use an action to transport all attuned creatures back and forth between the two planes. After these 24 hours have passed, the power drains from the mirror, and it can't be activated again until it is recharged. Each phase mirror has a different recharge time and limit to the number of creatures that can be attuned to it, depending on the mirror's size.",

            "desc": "Ancient beyond meaning, the Devouring King known as Nyth’Zerogg spreads across the multiverse, infecting a plane with a portion of himself before consuming it. Whether summoned or drawn by hunger, the mind-bending entity crosses black seas of infinity to gorge upon mortal civilizations and gods alike.\n\nRarely in the uncounted eons of his existence, the spore of the Devouring King is denied. In this reality primordial powers drove him back before he took root, destroying him almost completely. Of his titanic form only a piece of skull, a fragment of wing membrane, and a piece of its strange heart survived. Nyth'zerogg's might was such that even these pieces contain terrible power, housing a fragment of his essence and a shard of his alien psyche.\n\nSince Nyth’Zerogg’s destruction pieces of the raiment have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth’Zerogg so that he may consume all reality. The _Raiment of the Devouring King_ consists of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a process that takes a minute, during which you are _incapacitated_  by agony. Once attuned, pieces can only be removed if you are killed.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is part of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds. \n\n**DC 18** There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.\n\n**DC 21** The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer’s body, and the orb enhances their mind.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nWhile you are attuned to any piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ you are subject to Malignant Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:\n\n* You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.\n* You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the _Raiment of the Devouring King’s_ magical properties (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4+1 charges each dusk.\n\n**A Complete Set**\n\nBecause of their powerful desire to be together, no matter how many pieces of the Raiment of the Devouring King you wear they count as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement. For each additional piece of the Raiment of the Devouring King that you acquire, you gain the following benefits:\n\n**_Two Pieces._** Your pool of charges increases to 12\\. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an _incapacitated_  or _unconscious_  creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner can only be returned to life by means of a _wish_ or __true resurrection ._\n\n_**Three Pieces.**_ Your pool of charges increases to 16\\. When you take a _short rest_ , you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4+1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become _poisoned_  while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.\n\nYou cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded __wish_ spell. Instead, you return to life 1d3 days later.\n\n**Cloak of the Devouring King**\n\nThis deep jade cloak resembles a large piece of torn wing membrane. When attuned, it grafts to your back, reweaving muscle and bone and turning into a single leathery wing that grants a portion of Nyth’zerogg’s vitality.\n\n While attuned to the _Cloak of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Constitution score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Constitution is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a fly speed equal to your Speed.\n* You regain 1d8 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns if you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, you regrow the missing part within 1d6 days.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: _longstrider_ (1 charge), __misty step_  (2 charges), __blink_ (3 charges), _dimension door_  (4 charges), __plane shift_  (5 charges), or _teleport_ (5 charges)\n\n**Crown of the Devouring King**\n\nThe alabaster crown resembles a jagged piece of flat bone affixed to a crude iron band. When worn, it settles so that a single spoke of bone extends above the wearer's eye. When you attune to the skull, it grafts with your bone and grants a portion of Nyth’zerogg’s strength.\n\nWhile attuned to the _Crown of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Strength score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.\n* Your body transforms, turning a rubbery gray green as chitinous bone plates emerge from your skin. This counts as a suit of _1 leather_ if you are proficient with light armor, a suit of _1 breastplate_  if you are proficient with medium armor, or a suit of   _1 full plate_  if you are proficient with heavy armor. This armor does not impose _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You can use an action to spend 1 charge to shape chitin and bone from your body into a +1 weapon. You may only have two such weapons in existence at a time. Any ammunition needed is created as the weapon is fired. You may spend 1 charge as part of an action to deliver touch spells through a weapon created in this manner by making a single weapon attack as a part of that action. A weapon created in this manner crumbles to dust a round after it leaves your person.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __shield_  (1 charge), __enlarge/reduce_  (2 charges), __protection from energy_ (self only; 2 charges), _stoneskin_ (self only; 3 charges).\n\n**Orb of the Devouring King**\n\nThis crimson orb resembles a massive, calcified heart suspended on a crude chain. When the orb returns to life, hooked tendrils extend and burrow into your chest, lodging it there where it grants a portion of the god’s mind and knowledge.\n\n While attuned to the _Orb of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Choose Intelligence or Charisma. The chosen ability score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if the chosen ability score is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a 1d10 expertise die on Intelligence checks.\n* When you take a short rest, you can recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level or higher by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot recovered.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __detect thoughts_ (1 charge)_, suggestion_ (2 charges), __black tentacles_ (3 charges), _telekinesis_  (4 charges), _dominate monster_  (5 charges).\n\n**Malignant Influence**\n\nEach piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ longs to be united with the others so that Nyth’Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_  once per month or gain a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be removed while you are attuned to the _Raiment of the Devouring King._ With two pieces of the artifact attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.\n\n_**Level 1**._ You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.\n\n_**Level 2.**_ You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of _fatigue_  that persists until you consume such a creature.\n\n_**Level 3.**_ You fall entirely under the sway of the Raiment of the Devouring King. You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth’Zerogg reborn. You immediately become an NPC under the Narrator’s control.\n\n**Awakening Nyth’Zerogg**\n\nIf all three pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ graft to a single host and they acquire three levels of Malignant Influence, the host’s mind and soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth’zerogg’s reawakening. The exact consequences of such a reawakening are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction level threat to mortals and gods alike.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nMany attempts have been made to destroy pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ yet they always reform. Some believe that they can only be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire—though even this is just a theory.",

As an action, you can destroy the token by crushing it and sprinkling the remains into a river, calming the waters to a gentle current and soothing nearby water-dwelling creatures for 1 hour. Water-dwelling beasts in the river with an Intelligence of 3 or lower are soothed and indifferent toward passing humanoids for the duration. The token's magic soothes but doesn't fully suppress the hostilities of all other water-dwelling creatures. For the duration, each other water-dwelling creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to attack or take hostile actions toward passing humanoids. The token's soothing magic ends on a creature if that creature is attacked.",

At the end of each of its turns, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.\n* **Terrify:** The target makes a DC 17 Wisdom _saving throw_  or is _frightened_  for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.\n\n**Six Buttons.** The rod has buttons along its haft which alter its form when pressed. You can press one of the buttons as a bonus action, and the effect lasts until you push a different button for a new effect, or press the same button again causing the rod to revert to its default form.\n\n* **Button 1:** The rod loses its bonus to attack and damage rolls, instead producing a fiery blade from its haft which you can wield as a _flame tongue_  sword.\n* **Button 2:** The rod transforms into a magic battleaxe.\n* **Button 3:** The rod transforms into a magic spear.\n* **Button 4:** The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long. A spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole into any surface as hard as granite. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Either excess weight or a lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its default form.\n* **Button 5:** The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram that grants a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n* **Button 6:** The rod assumes or remains in its default form and indicates magnetic north, and how far above or below ground that you are. Nothing happens if this function is used in a location without a magnetic north, or a ground as a reference point.",

If you are holding the rod and fail a saving throw against a transmutation spell or other effect that would change your body or remove or alter parts of you, you can choose to succeed instead. The rod can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. The rod has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rings fall off, the cord unknots, and the entire rod slowly falls to pieces and is destroyed. Cure Transformation. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge while touching a creature that has been affected by a transmutation spell or other effect that changed its physical form, such as the polymorph spell or a medusa's Petrifying Gaze. The rod restores the creature to its original form. If the creature is willingly transformed, such as a druid using Wild Shape, you must make a melee weapon attack roll, using the rod. You are proficient with the rod if you are proficient with clubs. On a hit, you can expend 1 of the rod’s charges to force the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target reverts to its original form. Mend Form. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 2 charges to reattach a creature's severed limb or body part. The limb must be held in place while you use the rod, and the process takes 1 minute to complete. You can’t reattach limbs or other body parts to dead creatures. If the limb is lost, you can spend 4 charges instead to regenerate the missing piece, which takes 2 minutes to complete. Reconstruct Form. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 5 charges to reconstruct the form of a creature or object that has been disintegrated, burned to ash, or similarly destroyed. An item is completely restored to its original state. A creature’s body is fully restored to the state it was in before it was destroyed. The creature isn’t restored to life, but this reconstruction of its form allows the creature to be restored to life by spells that require the body to be present, such as raise dead.",

For example, you can forbid a creature from lying only if you are capable of determining if the creature is lying, and you can't forbid a creature that needs to breathe from breathing. The creature can act normally, but if it performs the activity you forbid, you can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it with the rod. You can forbid only one creature at a time. If you forbid another creature from performing an activity, the previous creature is no longer forbidden from performing activities. Justicars are arbiters of law and order, operating independently of any official city guard or watch divisions. They are recognizable by their black, hooded robes, silver masks, and the rods they carry as weapons. These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title. The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings. Each by itself is a useful item, but they are made stronger when worn together. The combined powers of this trinity of items make a Justicar a formidable force in the pursuit of law and order.",

Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and make one attack roll with this whip against that creature. If the attack hits, that creature and each creature in a line that is 5 feet wide between you and the target takes damage as if hit by this whip. All of this damage is radiant.

With all manner of wheels, gears, cables, and hinges, when worn its movements are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and heavy.\n\nThe last of its kind, the _Serveros War Engine_ was used by a forgotten empire's soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their kingdom. It’s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they wrought.\n\nMounting the war engine is a fairly straightforward matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in this way.\n\nWhen controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing pain through its body.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Serveros War Engine_, the last war machine of a forgotten empire. \n\n**DC 18** The engine is piloted from inside, and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In addition to offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons, and other effects.\n\n**DC 21** Destroying the engine requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Serveros War Engine_ has one lesser artifact benefit. Piloting the war engine can be quite taxing, both mentally and physically. You gain no benefits from a _long or short rest_  while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of _fatigue_  and _strife_ .\n\nWhile you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the _Serveros War Engine_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your AC becomes 18.\n* Your Strength score becomes 21.\n* You are Huge-sized.\n* Your Speed becomes 40 feet.\n* You have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  made to avoid being _grappled_  or knocked _prone_ .\n* You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.\n* Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.\n* Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.\n* You have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You are vulnerable to psychic damage.\n\n**Charged Properties**\n\nThe war engine also has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or drain energy from your life force.\n\n* A massive sword hilt is secured to the construct’s hip by an incredible magnetic force. You can use a bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade.\n\n_**Plasma Blade**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.\n\n* An arcane cannon is housed in the construct’s left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon.\n\n_**Arcane Cannon**_. _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 120/300 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d6) radiant damage.\n\n* The construct’s right hand is detachable. You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the gauntlet as a projectile.\n\n_**Gauntlet Grapple.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 60/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6+5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is _grappled_ . You can use a bonus action to retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.\n\n The _Serveros War Engine_ begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a _long rest_ .\n\n**Warframe Variations**\n\nThe Narrator may apply one or more of the following variant options if desired.\n\n_**Airborne.**_ You can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute.\n\n_**Disrepair.**_ When first discovered, the _Serveros War Engine_ may be completely depleted of stored charges and heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a wish spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible power.\n\n_**Glass Jaw.**_ When the _Serveros War Engine_ takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the war engine’s head is knocked off, disabling the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering) check and 8 hours of work.\n\n_**Mortal Echoes.**_ The _Serveros War Engine’s_ last pilot died while mounted within the war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct. When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma _saving throw_ . On a failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term _mental stress effect_ .\n\n**_Nautical._** You gain a swim speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with breathable air which lasts for 1 hour.\n\n_**Recon.**_ You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the construct’s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the construct does not cause you to have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.\n\n_**Serveros Slayer.**_ In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist, the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to deploy one or both psyblades. \n\n_**Psyblade.** Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) psychic damage.\n\n_**Specialized Weaponry**_. Instead of a giant plasma sword, the _Serveros War Engine_ has one of the following weapons. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the weapon.\n\n_**Discus Throwing Shield**. Melee_ or _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ reach 5 ft. or range 40/80 ft., one target, or if thrown two targets within 10 feet of each other. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage. In addition, while the shield is donned your AC increases by 2.\n\n_**Extendable Metal Staff**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18 (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength _saving throw_  or is knocked _prone_ .\n\n_**Shocking Net.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 30/60 ft., all targets in a 15-foot square area. _Hit:_ 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is _grappled_ . At the start of your turn, conscious creatures grappled by the net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

The rest of the massive construct might feasibly be replaced or reengineered by an ingenious mind. However with its complex structure, both magical and mechanical, replicating the controller headpiece requires arcane knowledge and technical documentation that disappeared with the war engine’s creators long ago. \n\nThe helm is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical protections requires two steps: first, a __dispel magic_ cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around the war engine’s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a __disintegrate_ spell cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections regenerate and fully repair it.",

            "name": "Servile Shabti",
            "type": "Wondrous item",
            "desc": "Crafted to serve in place of the dead in the afterlife, shabti are often used by the living for their own ends. These 1-foot-tall statuettes are crafted of ceramic, stone, or terracotta and are garbed in gear indicative of their function. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the shabti to a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, it grows into a Medium construct that performs the tasks for which it was created. If the space where the shabti would grow is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the shabti, the shabti doesn’t grow. Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti’s description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti’s Armor Class is 13, and it doesn’t have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti’s description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti’s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft— weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade—and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan’s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items. Once it completes its task, the shabti reverts to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until a number of hours have passed equal to twice the market value in gold pieces of the item crafted (minimum of 10 hours). Defender Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. You can use a bonus action to command the shabti to either defend you or harass an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you. If the shabti defends you, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has disadvantage on melee weapon attack rolls against you. If the shabti harasses a creature, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against that creature. The shabti remains active for up to 8 hours, after which it reverts to statuette form and can’t be used again until 3 days have passed. Digger Shabti (Uncommon). The shabti carries a shovel and pick. You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don’t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed. Healer Shabti (Very Rare). This shabti is dressed in scholarly robes and carries a bag of medical supplies. It is proficient with a healer’s kit, has Medicine +7, and tends to the wounds of you and your companions. If directed to administer care when you take a short rest, the shabti can tend the wounds of up to six creatures over the course of the hour. Each creature that spends Hit Dice to regain hit points during that short rest increases the amount gained per Hit Die by 2, up to the maximum number that can be rolled. The shabti follows you and tends to the wounds of you and your companions, as directed, for up to 8 hours before reverting to statuette form. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn’t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor’s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti’s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor’s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out. The shabti follows you and acts as directed for up to 8 hours or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it returns to statuette form. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.",

It was renowned for its supernatural sharpness, the hardness of its steel, and for the fact it was imbued with the spirits of his 12 most faithful berserkers. It later showed up in multiple different sagas, usually as a result of some new hero plundering it from Hrolf’s tomb for one purpose or another.",

            "desc": "A huge red ruby is set into the pommel of this intricately filigreed golden longsword. The jewel shimmers and shines as the blade speaks in a voice that resonates with a deep and distant baritone. Without this illusion, a twisted demonic form is revealed: the blade is composed of a single sharpened tooth, what appears to be the hilt is instead a grotesque sucker-like mouth, and the ruby pommel is a figment covering a single great crimson eye that stares with fiendish intelligence.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic longsword. An intense burning heat radiates from the blade and it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage on a successful hit. \n\n_**Attached Properties.**_ While attached to _Skrivena Moc,_ you gain resistance to fire, proficiency with longswords, and after taking the Attack action on your turn you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using it. However, the weapon forms a permanent bond with its wielder and cannot be put down or removed once wielded.\n\n_**Corruption.**_ At the end of each week that _Skrivena Moc_ is attached to you, your Charisma score is decreased by 1d4\\. When you have lost 6 or more Charisma in this way, raised black veins radiate out from the point of _Skrivena Moc’s_ attachment. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until _Skrivena Moc_ is no longer attached to you, at which point you recover 1 Charisma at the end of each long rest.\n\n_**Fiend Transformed.**_ This elegantly crafted longsword of filigreed gold whispers promises of greater treasures to come—yet those who wield it are doomed. In truth it is an imprisoned _balor_  reduced in power by potent enchantments, the elegant blade only an illusion. Any that dare grasp the infernal hilt know not their peril, unaware they are actually plunging their hand into a fiendish maw.\n\n_**Sentience.** Skrivena Moc_ is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 22\\. It has hearing and truesight to a range of 120 feet. The longsword communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Abyssal, Common, and up to 3 other languages of the Narrator’s choice.\n\n_**Personality.**_ _Skrivena Moc_ needs a wielder to accomplish much of anything and it is a peerless manipulator. Wrathful and vindictive, the fiend blade sees those who carry it as insignificant and a means to an end. However it has been stuck in this form for centuries and has learned to maintain a helpful and subservient façade to better facilitate the careful orchestration of events whenever possible, only revealing its true intentions as a last resort. Once wielded, the fiend blade grabs hold and cannot be dropped. The demon makes hasty apologies for its “curse”, manipulating its wielder into serving its will—it acts as a powerful weapon but slowly drains away their vital essences until they die, all the while using them to track down potential cures for its transformation.\n\n**Forgotten Fiend**\n\nLong ago Skrivena Moc was defeated by the great elven wizard Stariji. Rather than banish the demon and allow it to reform in the Abyss, the mage transformed the evil monster into something more useful: a sword to bestow upon her champions. It suffered for centuries as a tool of justice, made to forcefully cut down hundreds of fiends in the name of its most hated enemy. After nearly a millennium of belligerent service however, Stariji finally succumbed to her age and died peacefully in her bed. With the elven wizard and all her champions gone Skrivena Moc was left to molder deep within its cursed enemy’s home amongst other treasures—but as centuries passed it eventually was discovered and has escaped to wreak havoc on the world once more.\n\nSkrivena Moc constructs a web of lies, propping itself up as Stariji’s most trusted warrior who chose to serve the elven mage against evil even after death. It promises everything an adventurer could want and more if only they’ll wield it—and the demon keeps its promises, in a way. The fiend blade is powerful even in untrained hands, though it is also full of deception. Whatever lies and half-truths the sword produces, it has only one goal in mind: Skrivena Moc wishes to return to its true demonic form. Stariji’s old enchantment has weakened over the centuries and allowed for some of its fiendish essence to leach out, but it still cannot escape the mage’s trap. As it seems the old wizard never shared her techniques, Skrivena Moc must find her spellbook, the only known source that contains the techniques to restore its form. Even death cannot save it, as the mage ensured that it cannot be destroyed only to reform in the Abyss while in this cursed shape.\n\n**Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade Challenge 4+**\n\n_Small fiend_ 1,100 XP+\n\n**Armor Class** 19 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 180 (19d6+114)\n\n**Speed** 0 ft.\n\n**STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA**\n\n26 (+8)15 (+2)22 (+6)20 (+5)16 (+3)22 (+6)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver DC** 19\n\n**Saving Throws** Con +8, Wis +5, Cha +8\n\n**Skills** Arcana +9, Deception +10, History +9, Insight +7, Intimidation +10, Investigation +9, Perception +7, Persuasion +10\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** fire, poison\n\n**Condition Immunities** _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 17\n\n**Languages** Abyssal, Common, telepathy 120 ft.\n\n_**Death Throes.**_ When Skrivena Moc dies it explodes and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites unattended flammable objects in the area. Any creature currently attached to Skrivena Moc has _disadvantage_  on this save.\n\n_**Demonic Blade.**_ While Skrivena Moc is attached to a creature, the creature gains the attached template.\n\n_**Immobile.**_ Skrivena Moc has been magically forced into the form of a blade and is unable to move on its own. It is considered _restrained_  and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity checks and _saving throws_ .\n\n_**Magic Resistance**_. Skrivena Moc has _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against spells and other magical effects.\n\n**_Prized Glamer._** Skrivena Moc has an illusion around it that makes it look and feel like a golden longsword. Creatures who physically interact with the figment can determine that the sword is glamored with a DC 22 Arcana or Investigation check. Skrivena Moc can use a bonus action to activate or dismiss this illusion.\n\n_**Variable Challenge Rating.**_ Skrivena Moc’s CR is equal to its wielder’s level or CR (minimum CR 4).\n\nACTIONS\n\n**_Corrupting Siphon (Recharge 5–6)_**. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Constitution _saving throw_  or reduces its Charisma by 2 (1d4). Skrivena Moc regains 1d8 hit points for each point of Charisma lost in this way. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until Skrivena Moc is no longer attached to the creature, at which point it recovers 1 Charisma at the end of each _long rest_ .\n\n_**Demonic Leeching (3/Day)**_. Skrivena Moc uses its natural resistances to filter out its wielder’s ailments, ending either the _poisoned_  condition or one nonmagical _disease_  afflicting the attached creature.\n\n_**Grip of Control.**_ The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Wisdom _saving throw_  or temporarily loses control to the fiend blade until the end of Skrivena Moc’s next turn (as __dominate person_ ).\n\n_**Trusty Blade**_. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Charisma _saving throw_  or it is _charmed_  for the next hour. If the attached creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. \n\nREACTIONS\n\n_**Fiendish Attachment.**_ When a creature grasps Skrivena Moc’s hilt, it can use reaction to attach to the creature. Once attached, the creature cannot let go and is forced to wield Skrivena Moc with whatever limb it used to grab the hilt. Skrivena Moc can use an action to detach from a creature and otherwise detaches when it dies, the attached limb is severed, or if it is dealt 35 or more radiant damage in a single round.\n\n_**Justified Paranoia**_. Whenever Skrivena Moc hears its name mentioned or is otherwise suspicious of a creature, it can use its reaction to telepathically delve into the creature’s mind (as _detect thoughts_ ; save DC 19).",

The coat can hold up to 40 pounds of material in up to 10 different extradimensional pockets. Nothing can be placed inside the coat that won't fit in a pocket.

As a bonus action, you can force the pockets to become visible on the coat. While you maintain concentration, the coat displays its four outer pockets, two on each side, four inner pockets, and two pockets on each sleeve. While the pockets are visible, any creature you allow can store or retrieve an item as an action. If the coat is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. Placing the coat inside an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding, instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

If your bonded partner succeeds, you can choose to succeed on the saving throw that you failed.\n- You can use a bonus action to concentrate on the magical bond between you to determine your bonded partner's status. You become aware of the direction and distance to your bonded partner, whether they are unharmed or wounded, any conditions that may be currently affecting them, and whether or not they are afflicted with an addiction, curse, or disease.

For example, if you are affected by the mage armor spell and it has 4 hours remaining, you can use an action to touch your bonded partner to give them the benefits of the mage armor spell, reducing the duration to 2 hours on each of you.\n- If your bonded partner dies, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

This has no effect on creatures affected by an _invisibility_  spell. You can also take a picture manually as a reaction. Once a picture is taken, you must spend an action to prepare the camera for another.\n\nUnlike physical objects, incorporeal beings do not need to stay still to appear on the resulting photo, though the entire process takes 1 minute to complete. Such photos do not need to be developed and show ghostly subjects in crisp detail, while all mundane aspects (chairs, corporeal creatures, etc.) are at best mildly blurry.\n\nEach picture taken with a spectral camera costs 2 gp in materials, which are significantly rarer than those for a mundane photograph.

The clone may choose to pursue a different class or profession than you. Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 12 Wisdom check or it acquires a _short-term mental stress effect_ .                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| 16–17   | Something is off. The clone may have different colored eyes or hair, new birthmarks or blemishes, or other minor differences (such as a different score in one or two abilities). Such differences are easy to hide and can be difficult to spot. These differences prey on the clone’s mind when it is near you. Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 12 Wisdom check or it acquires a _short-term mental stress effect_ .                   |\n| 18      | The clone is obviously imperfect. At the Narrator’s discretion, the clone may be noticeably shorter, taller, heavier, or lighter than you. The clone has _disadvantage_  on any attempts to disguise itself as you. Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 14 Wisdom check or it acquires a _long-term mental stress effect_ .                                                                                                                  |\n| 19      | The clone is effectively a reincarnation of you. Roll on Table: _Reincarnation_  to determine the clone’s heritage. Whenever the clone can see you, it needs to make a DC 14 Wisdom check or it acquires a _long-term mental stress effect_ .                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 20      | There is a darkness within the clone and it wants to replace you. No matter how perfect the copy, the clone always attacks you on sight with the intent to kill (at the Narrator’s discretion, the clone may delay such an act if it would be immediately beneficial to the clone—once the benefit is gone, the bloodlust returns). The clone also plots against you when not in its presence, hiring assassins or otherwise attempting to vex or destroy you. |\n\n**Note:** Particular _mental stress effects_  do not stack. For example, if the clone has both a personality change and develops a phobia, it only needs to make a single DC 14 Wisdom check when it sees you.",

Should its lost gemstones be returned, the blade might be restored to its full spectrum of glory and power.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Sword of Three Traditions,_ which grants mastery of the techniques of combat. Each of the three gemstones in its hilt represents a tradition of combat.\n\n**DC 18** The sword can transform into other weapons based on the gemstones in its hilt.\n\n**DC 21** Only a dragon of the same color can destroy the sword’s gemstones.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. For each of the first five magical gemstones restored to the sword, it gains 1 lesser artifact benefit. For each of the last three magical gemstones restored to it, the sword gains 1 greater artifact detriment and 1 greater artifact benefit.\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ is a   _1 longsword_ . Once you are attuned, you can use an action to turn the sword into a different _1 weapon ._ In addition, when you use a combat maneuver, the sword automatically changes into the weapon associated with that tradition. To change into a given weapon, the gem associated with that tradition must be attached. \n\nWhile holding the sword, when you use a combat maneuver of a tradition associated with an attached gem, its exertion cost is reduced by 1 (minimum 1 exertion).\n\n**Magical Gemstones**\n\nEach of the lost magical gemstones of the _Sword of Three Traditions_ is a wondrous item and artifact that requires attunement. Once attuned to a magical gemstone, it bestows a minor artifact benefit. You can only attune to the magical gemstone if you know a combat maneuver from the tradition associated with it. \n\nYou can use an action to attach a magical gemstone to the sword.

While attuned to it, you can read it as though you are reading your first language. Reading the _Song of Creation_ reveals beautiful poetry about nature, light, and life, but structurally they do not make sense when read start-to-end. The poems cannot be perfectly translated, as each individual interprets the same poem differently.

It’s magical properties become apparent however when it moves, as it stands on hundreds of tiny humanoid legs and opens to reveal a long red tongue and a rim dotted with sharp teeth. It functions like a typical chest with the following additional properties.\n\n**_Mimic-Like._** _The Traveling Chest_ can use an action to appear to be a mundane chest, and you can verbally command it to do so. While mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable from its mundane counterpart.\n\n_**Multiple Interiors.** The Traveling Chest_ has 1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request any particular space (such as the last one, or the one with my laundry in it) and when opened the chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest opens to reveal a random interior space. While the chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed. Only you can summon up the other interiors in this way, and any other creature that opens the chest only finds the “first interior”.\n\n_**Relentless.**_ Once you attune to _The Traveling Chest_, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is magically aware of your location at all times, even if you are on a separate plane. If separated from you the chest travels towards you as fast as it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If you are functionally unreachable, such as being on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest still progresses using even esoteric or hidden methods of reaching you such as magic portals or stowing away on ships headed in your direction.\n\n_**Imprinted.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ does not relinquish attunement once attuned, and you cannot voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune to additional magic items beyond your limit, _The Traveling Chest_ always remains as one of your attuned items. \n\n_**Pack Lightly.** The Traveling Chest_ does not like being weighed down too much, and can carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional bulky items you attempt to store within it are spit out. \n\n_**Sentience.** The Traveling Chest_ is a sentient construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 12\\. It has blindsight to a range of 60 feet. _The Traveling Chest_ cannot speak or read, but it understands Common and Elvish. _The Traveling Ches_t lacks proper communication, but can animalistically communicate simple emotions (most often boredom or rage).\n\n_**Personality.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ has the intellect and temperament of a poorly trained dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly committed to following whomever is attuned to it. It also isn’t a fighter and ignores outright commands to attack, though it defends itself in combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for its intended purpose, happiest when numerous items are stored within it and regularly retrieved. If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces, or remains indignantly locked, and it generally acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a full wardrobe’s worth of new clothing to store as a peace offering.\n\n---\n\n**The Traveling Chest Challenge 7**\n\n_Medium construct_ 2,900 XP\n\n**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 119 (14d6+70)\n\n**Speed** 50 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n18 (+4) 14 (+2) 20 (+5) 3 (–4) 14 (+2) 12 (+1)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver** DC 15\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison, thunder\n\n**Condition Immunities** _fatigued_ , _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12\n\n**Languages** understands but can not speak Common, Elvish\n\n**_False Appearance._** While _The Traveling Chest_ remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary chest.\n\n_**Immutable Form**_. The chest is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.\n\nACTION\n\n**_Bite._** _Melee Weapon Attack_: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is _grappled_  (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is _restrained_ , and the chest can't bite another target.\n\n_**Swallow.**_ The chest makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is _grappling_ . If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is _blinded_  and _restrained_ , it has _total cover_  against attacks and other effects outside the chest, and it begins _suffocating_  at the start of each of the chest’s turns. If the chest takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the chest regurgitates all swallowed creatures along with up to 1d10 other random items that were stored within it, all of which falls _prone_  in a space within 10 feet of the chest. If the chest dies, all swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it, and they and any items reappear randomly in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the destroyed chest. ",

Additionally, you can speak the blade’s command word as a bonus action to cause it to shed _bright light_  in a 20-foot radius and _dim light_  for an additional 20 feet. Repeating the command word or sheathing the blade extinguishes the light. Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the weapon’s damage dice can deal.\n\nTyrfing has 9 charges, which it does not regain while attuned to a creature. These charges are fully restored if a new creature attunes to it, but a previous bearer who attunes to the sword again only ever has the same pool of charges. When you use the sword to deal a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct or undead and has 100 or fewer hit points, it must make a DC 16 Constitution _saving throw_ . Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword expends a charge.\n\n**_Curse._** Prior to 3 charges being expended from the blade, it will cause some tragedy or misfortune to befall you and will not expend its third charge until it has. The exact details and timing of this evil are up to the Narrator, but good examples include: causing you to automatically fail a crucial ability check (particularly one that would lead to further disaster, such as failing to identify an ally in the dark and accidentally attacking them); causing an ally who is reduced to 0 hit points to be incapable of rolling successes on death saving throws, leading to their death unless they are healed or stabilized by another creature; or causing all your next critical hits during a given combat to miss instead.\n\nMisfortune occurs again before 6 charges have been expended, and it will not expend the sixth until it has done so. Likewise, it must do so a third time before expending the final charge. If you break your attunement with Tyrfing with a pending misfortune, you remain _cursed_  until either the misfortune occurs or until you are targeted by a _remove curse_  spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot.\n\nOn expending the final charge, you must make a DC 16 constitution save. On a failure, you are slain by the sword just as surely as your opponent. On a success, you instead gain the _doomed_  condition, dying soon thereafter in a tragic manner unless powerful magic intervenes. Regardless of the result, Tyrfing then disappears. 1 week later it appears somewhere on your plane, searching for a new wielder to afflict.\n\n_Note:_ The exact mechanics of the following curse are for the Narrator and should be kept vague for players, even if they discover it is cursed. It is enough in that case for them to know Tyrfing will bring about three great evils and eventually the death of its wielder. The sword is nothing if not persistent, and attempts to leave it behind without breaking attunement merely mean that Tyrfing appears near its bearer 24 hours later.\n\n### Lore\n\nTyrfing was a sword forged under duress by the dwarves Svalinn and Durinn for Svafrlami, a king and grandson of Odin. Per his instructions, it shown with bright light, could cut through stone and steel as easily as flesh, and would never dull or rust. However, because their services were obtained under duress by threat of force, they also cursed the blade so that whenever drawn it would take a life, that it would bring about three great evils, and that it would eventually take Svafrlami’s life. This all came to pass, and the sword continued to bring disaster and ruin to each new wielder, its cursed hunger for tragedy never sated.",

            "desc": "Few powers are more coveted than the ability to examine and manipulate the threads of fate, and yet destiny is a mystery that most have yet to fully comprehend. As enigmatic as the forces it commands, the origins of the Veil of Fate are unknown. It was brought to historical attention when it was revealed as the source of a renowned seer’s remarkable abilities, her foretellings reached the ears of queens and generals, shaping a continent and undoubtedly the whole of history. Fearful of her influence and envious of the veil’s power, those outside of her circle of influence conspired to behead her and take the relic. The subsequent fighting and intrigue saw the Veil of Fate become lost for centuries, occasionally appearing in tales as fantastic as they were inscrutable. While this tale is the best known, records of the Veil of Fate’s existence can be traced to the beginnings of written history, its bearers painted as either titans of achievement or dire warnings to be heeded by the wise.\n\nThe Veil of Fate is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer’s head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Veil of Fate_, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny. \n\n**DC 18** The veil grants glimpses into the future.\n\n**DC 21** Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Veil of Fate_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nWhen you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have _disadvantage_  on _opportunity attacks_  against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.\n\nThe glimpses of the future granted by the _Veil of Fate_ are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.\n\nIn addition, you can impart some of the veil’s power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the _Veil of Fate_ onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of _fatigue_  from the effort.\n\n**Foretelling**\n\nAt the Narrator’s discretion, when you first attune to the Veil of Fate you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it. Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you’ve forgotten it.\n\n**Choose Your Destiny**\n\nWhile attuned to the Veil of Fate you are keenly aware of your own destiny. \n\nWhen you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life’s purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new _Destiny_ .\n\n**Control Fate**\n\nWhen you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.\n\nIn addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20\\. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, _attack roll_ , or _saving throw_ , you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll’s effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.\n\n**Magic**\n\nYou may cast _augury_  at will while attuned to and wearing the _Veil of Fate_.\n\nTwice per _long rest_  you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: _arcane eye , clairvoyance , commune , divination_ .\n\nRoll a d20 after each _long rest_ . On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the __foresight_ spell.",

Arcane societies tend to look down upon the people that deign to use this artifact and refuse to recognize it for what it truly is, perpetuating the belief that it is a cursed relic best left alone. Any knowledgeable scholar knows there is good reason for the practice—sometimes when left idle for too long without a master the hut walks of its own accord directly towards the nearest planar portal, and all those known to have claimed ownership have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. \n\nA simple bed and table permanently affixed to the floor in this shuttered wooden hut, and it is able to fit up to 12 Medium or smaller creatures inside. After taking a _long rest_  inside of the hut, you make a DC 21 Perception check, seeing through the veil and revealing its true nature on a success—strange markings and other signs of witchcraft cover nearly every surface of the interior and it reeks of chicken effluent. Once the veil is seen through, there are 8 glowing runes on the table, each only half-illuminated. When you pass your hand over a rune, the energies inside respond and you can fully illuminate it or remove its glow entirely. When certain runes are illuminated, enormous chicken legs beneath the hut rise it up off of the ground. The _Chicken Hut_ is a Gargantuan object with an Armor Class of 21, a total of 320 hit points, Speed 50 ft. or swim 10 ft. (0 ft. if the legs aren’t extended), and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.\n\nThe hut floats on water. While the hut’s door and window shutters are closed, the interior is airtight and watertight. The interior holds enough air for 60 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nYou can use an action to control the illumination of as many as two of the hut’s runes, and a bonus action to control a third. After each use, a rune goes back to its neutral position.

On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears.\n\n__**Table: Wand of Wonder**__\n| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 01–05    | You cast _slow ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 06–10    | You cast __faerie fire ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 11–15    | You are awestruck and become _stunned_  until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 16–20    | You cast _gust of wind ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 21–25    | You cast __detect thoughts_  on the target.

This is an addition to the shield's normal AC bonus. Air Bubble. Whenever you are immersed in a body of water while holding this shield, you can use a reaction to envelop yourself in a 10-foot radius bubble of fresh air. This bubble floats in place, but you can move it up to 30 feet during your turn. You are moved with the bubble when it moves. The air within the bubble magically replenishes itself every round and prevents foreign particles, such as poison gases and water-borne parasites, from entering the area. Other creatures can leave or enter the bubble freely, but it collapses as soon as you exit it. The exterior of the bubble is immune to damage and creatures making ranged attacks against anyone inside the bubble have disadvantage on their attack rolls. The bubble lasts for 1 minute or until you exit it. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. Sanctuary. You can use a bonus action to cast the sanctuary spell (save DC 13) from the shield. This spell protects you from only water elementals and other creatures composed of water. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.",

The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically bonded with you until the end of your next turn. While bonded in this way, you can choose to have advantage on attack rolls against the target or cause the target to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.",

While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cause a crimson zipline of magical force to extend from the gem in the ring and attach to up to two solid surfaces you can see. Each surface must be within 150 feet of you. Once the zipline is connected, you can use a bonus action to magically travel up to 50 feet along the line between the two surfaces. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. While the zipline is active, you remain suspended within 5 feet of the line, floating off the ground at least 3 inches, and you can't move more than 5 feet away from the zipline. When you magically travel along the line, you don't provoke opportunity attacks. The hand wearing the ring must be pointed at the line when you magically travel along it, but you otherwise can act normally while the zipline is active. You can use a bonus action to end the zipline. When the zipline has been active for a total of 1 minute, the ring's magic ceases to function until the next dawn.",

When the cushion deflates, it loudly repeats the phrase spoken into it along with somewhat humorous flatulence noise. This sound is clearly audible to a range of 50 feet.\n\nAlternatively, you can cast a cantrip or spell of 1st-level into the _Zlick’s message cushion_ so long as the words laughter, mockery, or whisper are in the spell name. When the cushion is deflated it casts the spell, targeting the creature that deflated it, and afterward it becomes a mundane item.",
